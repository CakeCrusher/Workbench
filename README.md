# Workbench

This is my first woodworking project!

As a developer it is my duty to post all projects on GitHub. So here is a (phisical) woodworking project on GitHub

I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMJ4Lob5Q4I&t=325s) as reference for the creation of the workbench.

## Part 1: Beams

Before making the beams I prepared this basic diagram detailing the vertical plan for the table.

<img src="https://github.com/CakeCrusher/Workbench/blob/master/1_beams/plan.jpg" align="center"
     alt="plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

I spent 2 hours making 3 of the 4 beams while simultaneously learning how to use the tools available to me and the basics of woodworking. The 4th one was made afterwords.

Below are the four beams. Each measures 33in in height.

## Part 2: Setup

I initially imagined this step would be making the walls of the workbench. As I began to draw the plan for it I realized that I would need to plan out the steps after before moving foreward. As a result I decided to finish the plan and set up all the wood for the upcoming steps.

Below is the completed plan.

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

After the plan was completed I started making measurments and observed some of the wood I laid out before me was of warn and a gentle motion away from breaking appart. Consequently, I became more selective on my wood choices. Little did I notice but 1 hr 30 mins passed and finally I prepared the measurements on the best wood I could find.

The next 20ish minutes I spent the wood.

Below are the 4x 52in long planks.

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

Below are the 4x 39in wall planks. (my legs made a cameo!)

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

## Part 3: Walls

For the walls I used the 39in planks to connect two beams. After I nailed the first connection I realized that the beams were not perfectly parallel. There are two likely reasons for this:

- the wood was bent
- the surface they were on was not completely flat

Below are the beams (regretfully) not parallel after being nailed together. (If you can see it off of this picture, you deserve an award, here have this üèÜ. Trust me though they're not parallel.)

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

To align them I put pressure on them with my foot while I nailed them down. (Serious acrobatics required for this move) Below is me aligning them with my foot.

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

Finally the two walls were completed.

## Part 4: Cubed

My newly aquired experience and the measuring and setup being behind me I presumed this would be one of the simpler parts of the build. This final stretch was just as difficult if not slightly more so. The primary reason for the increase in difficulty was weight. Untill that point I never considered the weight of the table but I quickly learned how impactful it would be. For one, nailing the first piece required a unique and more exhausting technique (I had to lay on my stomach, and put pressure on the nail while my arms hovered above the ground). Beneath is the picture of the first piece.

<img src="https://github.com/CakeCrusher/Workbench/blob/master/4_cube/first_connection.jpg" align="center"
     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

Then as I tried to rotate the workbench I suspected the workbench may break if I continue. Instead of rotating it I chose to just push it back and nail it from the other side. This presented another challenge in the form of friction. If I tried nailing it as it was, I would push the table before the nail went in. As a solution I added friction to the other side with the leftover planks I had.

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

As I was nailing the other plank I crossed paths with the consequence of build's imperfections. The imperfections resulted in a plank being elevated on one side. I responded by trying to clamp it only to learn the clamp was too short so I doubled the clamps by linking them together.

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

I then moved on to the next set of connections. Again facing the effects of imperfections I observed the walls were not parallel. To combat that I had to force them together, I looked for some kind of band that I could wrap around to tighten them, I found none. As a result I resorted to using used jumper cables I had laying around (it by no means was a perfect too but i had to make do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

<img src="https://github.com/CakeCrusher/Workbench/blob/master/4_cube/tension.jpg" align="center"
     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

Finally after nailing the remaining two planks the workbench was done!

## Part 5: Finished-bench

After an accumulated 7ish hours of planning, learning, and working I finished the table (working with crap wood makes the process much longer that it normally take otherwise).

I made some final measurements to ensure the table aligned with the plan. Fortunatly in measurements (which was all I planned for) (üêò weight was not...) it was virtually identical to the plan. The only inaccuracies came from the poor wood quality as some of it was bent as a result.

Below is the height of the workbench measuring at around 33in.

<img src="https://github.com/CakeCrusher/Workbench/blob/master/5_finishedbench/z.jpg" align="center"
     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

Next is the width of the workbench measuring roughly 42in. This was the most inaccurate with an inaccuracy of range (depending on where on the side you measured) of 0-2 tenths of an inch. This was due to the bend in the wood.

     alt="final plan" height="300px" style="border-radius: 10px;">

Finally the length of the workbench measured nearly 52in. With an inaccuracy of 0-1 tenths of an inch.

Here is a video of the finished workbench. In addition to showing the table I intend to share on social media in case your wondering why all the unecessary commentary ü•¥.
