# Workbench

This is my first woodworking project!

As a developer it is my duty to post all projects on GitHub. So here is a (phisical) woodworking project on GitHub

I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMJ4Lob5Q4I&t=325s) as reference for the creation of the workbench.

## Part 1: Beams

Before making the beams I prepared this basic diagram detailing the vertical plan for the table.

I spent 2 hours making 3 of the 4 beams while simultaneously learning how to use the tools available to me and the basics of woodworking. The 4th one was made afterwords.

Below are the four beams. Each measures 33in in height.
