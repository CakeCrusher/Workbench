# Workbench

This is my first woodworking project!

As a developer it is my duty to post all projects on GitHub. So here is a (phisical) woodworking project on GitHub

I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMJ4Lob5Q4I&t=325s) as reference for the creation of the workbench.

## Part 1: Beams

Before making the beams I prepared this basic diagram detailing the vertical plan for the table.

I spent 2 hours making 3 of the 4 beams while simultaneously learning how to use the tools available to me and the basics of woodworking. The 4th one was made afterwords.

Below are the four beams. Each measures 33in in height.

## Part 2: Setup

I initially imagined this step would be making the walls of the workbench. As I began to draw the plan for it I realized that I would need to plan out the steps after before moving foreward. As a result I decided to finish the plan and set up all the wood for the upcoming steps.

Below is the completed plan.

After the plan was completed I started making measurments and observed some of the wood I laid out before me was of warn and a gentle motion away from breaking appart. Consequently, I became more selective on my wood choices. Little did I notice but 1 hr 30 mins passed and finally I prepared the measurements on the best wood I could find.

The next 20ish minutes I spent the wood.

Below are the 4x 52in long planks.

Below are the 4x 39in wall planks. (my legs made a cameo!)
